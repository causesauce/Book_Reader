# Book_Reader
It is a program without UI that reads a text ( for example, of a book ) from a file and using one chain of stream operations creates a map where lengths of words are keys, and the values are lists of non-repeating words from the text with lengths corresponding to the key, but only those with all letters different (ignoring the case).
